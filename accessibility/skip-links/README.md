![enter image description here](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*lJ32Bl-lHWmNMUSiSq17gQ.png)
- In this project we implement from scratch a webpage from a designer file. We focus on the HTML structure without CSS or any styling. 

## Learning Objectives

-   **What is HTML?** HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and design web pages.
- **How do you create an HTML page from a wireframe?**   You need to translate the layout and features outlined in the wireframe into HTML code, typically using tags like `<div>`, `<span>`, and `<img>` to structure the page.
-   **What is a markup language?** A system for annotating a document in a way that is syntactically distinguishable from the text, and it's used to define the structure, presentation, and content.
-   **What is the DOM?** A programming interface for web documents, representing the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content.
-   **What is an element / tag?** A piece of code that describes the structure of web pages by marking different parts of content such as headings, paragraphs, and images.
-   **What is an attribute?** It provides additional information about an element's behavior, style, or content and is placed within the element's opening tag.
-   **What the purpose of each HTML tag?** To define the type of content being displayed, such as headings (`<h1>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), and many other types of data.

## Project Overview  
The project is structured around a main `index.html` file located in the `html_advanced` directory. This file serves as the entry point for the web application, showcasing various sections such as a header, main content area, and a footer. 

## Features

- **Header**: Contains the logo, navigation links, and a banner section with a title and a brief description.
- **Main Content**: Includes sections for tutorials, videos, membership details, and FAQs.
- **Footer**: Features copyright information and social media links.

## Designer file - Figma  
The design for the project was created using Figma, a popular design tool for creating user interfaces. The designer file serves as a blueprint for the web application, detailing the layout, colors, typography, and interactive elements that should be implemented in the HTML and CSS.

**The designer file can be accessed [here](https://intranet.atlasschool.com/rltoken/lhaBvvfXnyGKs9bRxokWtQ) to "Duplicate to your Drafts".**
